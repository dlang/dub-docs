## Environment variables in recipes
It is possible to define environment variables by specifying them inside the recipes (.json|.sdl). [Check the example.](https://github.com/dlang/dub/blob/master/test/environment-variables/dub.json)

## Syntax
```json
{
	"environments": {
		"ENVIRONMENTS": "root.environments",
		"VAR1": "root.VAR1",
		"VAR3": "root.VAR3",
		"PRIORITYCHECK_DEP_ROOT": "root.PRIORITYCHECK_DEP_ROOT",
		"PRIORITYCHECK_ROOT_DEPSPEC": "root.PRIORITYCHECK_ROOT_DEPSPEC",
		"PRIORITYCHECK_ROOT_DEPBLDSPEC": "root.PRIORITYCHECK_ROOT_DEPBLDSPEC"
	}
}
```

## User specified environment variables

![dub environment variables hierarchy](../images/environment-variable-hierarchy.png)

Environment variables are set by keys using the [defaultEnvironments](../dub-reference/settings.md#defaultenvironments) and related settings in the [user settings](../dub-reference/settings.md). Additionally, with higher precedence, environments and related settings in the [package recipe](../dub-reference/recipe.md#environment-variables) are loaded.

For finding the default environment variables first the system environment variables are loaded, then overridden by the user settings environment variables. This goes through all the default settings first.

Afterwards dependency or [recipe](../dub-guide/recipe.md#environment-variables) environment variables override these default environment variables. Recipe variables have higher precedence than dependency variables.

Defining a generic environments block inside a dependency overrides the keys set by e.g. defaultPreRunEnvironments inside the settings.
